#gcp-guess-who
This is a walkthrough demo project for students in CSC 111 Fall 2018 at Smith College. I created this demo to introduce the Google Cloud Platform API's to a class of beginner students as part of a guest lecture I had in CSC111, as a Google Cloud Platform Student Innovator.

# About the Project
The project uses the Google Cloud Vision API to detect labels for an image (inputted by the programmer) and simulates a "guess who" game. It is written in Python. Included in this project is a walkthrough.
